# survey-form

This is one of my very first projects using both HTML and CSS.

In this project i learned how to use forms and types extensively in order to create all the necessary inputs needed.
I also learned how to use CSS, more specifically padding, margin, and borders to make the website look,
more visually appealing to the user.
